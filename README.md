# Sweets To Go
This is a simple dessert ordering app. 
I produced the front end design with React Styled Components.

## Deployment
You can view the demo in this link:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# How it works
First, you see the homepage with one button to 'Make An Order'.<br>
Click on it and it will send you to the login page. <br>
If you don't have an account, you can always click on the sign-up link.<br>
<br>
Once, you've signed in, you see the menu page. The menu should be fetched 
from our back end, but this is only a front end example.<br>
When you choose a menu item and you click 'Add to cart', you see the purchase page.<br>
