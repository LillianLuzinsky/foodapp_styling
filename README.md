# Sweets To Go
This is a simple dessert ordering app. 
I produced the front end design with React Styled Components.

## Deployment
You can view the demo in this link:

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# How it works
First, you see the homepage with one button to 'Make An Order'.<br>
Click on it and it will send you to the login page. <br>
If you don't have an account, you can always click on the sign-up link.<br>
<br>
Once, you've signed in, you see the menu page. The menu should be fetched 
from our back end, but this is only a front end example.<br>
<br>
When you choose a menu item and you click 'Add to cart', you see the purchase page.<br>
In this page, you can add or subtract quantities of your chosen dessert. 
Once, you're happy with your purchase, you can click on the 'Confirm Purchase'
button and a modal will appear with a short message.<br>
<br>
Finally, this app includes an Account page, where you can see your purchase history

# Things I enjoyed

This is one of my first projects using React. I discovered styled-components and 
absolutely loved it. It makes styling a multipage website a lot more consistant 
and easier to keep track than adding all the stylings into the App.css file.

# Challenges

1) Initially, this was going to be a full stack app that uses 
Rails for back end and React for front end. As this was a group project,
I concentrated mostly giving our app presence through the front end design.
I didn't have the opportunity to work on the back end as much I would've liked to.
